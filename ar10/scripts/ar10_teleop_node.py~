#The following program can be used to publish to the "commands" topic to control the AR10 hand instead of using rostopic pub
#It can be opened from the ros workspace with the following commmand:
#rosrun ar10 ar10_teleop_node.py

import rospy

    pub = rospy.Publisher('commands', String, queue_size=10)

    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        command = raw_input("enter key >>").upper()
        rospy.loginfo(command)
        pub.publish(command)
        rate.sleep()
